What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Banner-Management allows you to manage banners on your TYPO3 website.
It supports image and HTML banners. Banner can be assigned multiple
categories which allows a flexible way of displaying them on a TYPO3 website.

The Extension fetches the banners for the desired page
**asynchronously** by using JavaScript (AJAX), so the page load time is not
mainly affected by the banner plugin.

Each banner contains a statistics, where the total amount of
impressions and clicks are shown. A banner can be limited to an amount
of maximum impressions and/or clicks.

The extension can be used as a plugin or by TypoScript.

The extension is developed with Extbase and Fluid.
