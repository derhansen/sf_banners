FAQ

I installed the extension but no banners are shown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure, that you included jQuery to your website and also make sure, that jQuery is included
at the top of all other JavaScript libraries.

If banners still do not get displayed and you use TYPO3 9.5 and the PageType Route Enhancer, make
sure that you configured a mapping - see :ref:`routing`

Can I use my own templates?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, this is possible since the extension is made with Extbase and
Fluid. You can configure template settings by TypoScript

How to prevent banner links to get indexed by search engines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since version 5.0.1 the extension instructs search engines to not index the "getBanners" action. This is done
by sending a `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` HTTP header in the "getBanners" action.

Additionally you should ensure, that banner links contain `rel="nofollow"` in your template.

You should also instruct search engines to not index links containing arguments of the extension. This can be done
by adding the following to your `robots.txt`::

  Disallow: /*tx_sfbanners_pi1    # no banners
